```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

We use the 'mtcars' dataset and understand the relation between various factors and weight('wt'). Graph is plotted between mileage('mpg') and weight('wt'), and the number of cylinders are being visualised.

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}

library(plotly)
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~mpg, y = ~wt, 
        color = ~as.factor(cyl), size = ~hp,
        text = ~paste("Weight: ", wt, '<br>MPG:', mpg),
        type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(title = "CAR DATA")

```
